\nThis game is called üêÇ Bulls & Cows üêÑ, and the rules are quite simple.
\nI'll come up with a secret ${numberLength}-digit number every time you start a new round ü§´ The digits will all be unique and will be between 0 and 9.
\nYou try to guess the number and are given the number of matches after each guess. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", otherwise they are "cows". 
\nEXAMPLE:\nSecret number: 4271\nYour attempt: 1234\nAnswer: 1 bull and 2 cows (the bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1")
\nThe goal is to guess the number (which is equivalent to getting 4 bulls) before you run out of remaining attempts.
\nYou also get to pick your difficulty level: 
\nEasy üëâ unlimited number of attempts\nDifficult üëâ 5 attempts\nLet Me Decide üëâ you decide the number of attempts you'll get`)
